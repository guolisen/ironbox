    "# Ironbox: Enhanced Agent Core and Framework Selection\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates how the enhanced Agent Core processes queries and selects the appropriate framework for handling different types of requests.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "The Agent Core is the central component of the Ironbox system that:\n",
    "1. Receives user queries\n",
    "2. Uses the Framework Selector to determine the best framework for handling the query\n",
    "3. Routes the query to the selected framework\n",
    "4. Returns the response to the user\n",
    "\n",
    "The Framework Selector can choose from four frameworks:\n",
    "- **Route Framework**: For simple categorizable queries that can be handled by specialized agents\n",
    "- **React Framework**: For reasoning and action problems that require tool use\n",
    "- **Plan Framework**: For complex multi-step problems that require planning\n",
    "- **Direct LLM**: For simple informational questions that can be answered directly\n",
    "\n",
    "The enhanced architecture introduces a **Unified Toolkit** that allows all frameworks to access both tools and agents, providing greater flexibility and power.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's explore how this works in practice."

    "In this notebook, we've explored how the Enhanced Agent Core and Framework Selection system works in Ironbox:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The Agent Core receives user queries and uses the Framework Selector to determine the best framework for handling them.\n",
    "2. The Unified Toolkit provides a central repository for all tools and agents, allowing any framework to access them.\n",
    "3. The Route Framework routes simple categorizable queries to specialized agents.\n",
    "4. The React Framework uses a thinking-action-observation loop to solve reasoning and action problems.\n",
    "5. The Plan Framework creates and executes plans for complex multi-step problems.\n",
    "6. Direct LLM responses handle simple informational questions.\n",
    "7. Agents can be used as tools, allowing React and Plan frameworks to leverage specialized agent capabilities.\n",
    "8. Tools and agents can be configured through configuration files, making the system more flexible and extensible.\n",
    "\n",
    "This enhanced architecture allows Ironbox to handle a wide range of query types efficiently, using the most appropriate approach for each situation, while providing greater flexibility and power through the unified toolkit."

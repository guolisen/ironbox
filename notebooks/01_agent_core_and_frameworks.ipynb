    "This notebook demonstrates how the Agent Core processes queries and selects the appropriate framework for handling different types of requests.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "The Agent Core is the central component of the Ironbox system that:\n",
    "1. Receives user queries\n",
    "2. Uses the Framework Selector to determine the best framework for handling the query\n",
    "3. Routes the query to the selected framework\n",
    "4. Returns the response to the user\n",
    "\n",
    "The Framework Selector can choose from four frameworks:\n",
    "- **Route Framework**: For simple categorizable queries that can be handled by specialized agents\n",
    "- **React Framework**: For reasoning and action problems that require tool use\n",
    "- **Plan Framework**: For complex multi-step problems that require planning\n",
    "- **Direct LLM**: For simple informational questions that can be answered directly\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's explore how this works in practice."

    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we've explored how the Agent Core and Framework Selection system works in Ironbox:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The Agent Core receives user queries and uses the Framework Selector to determine the best framework for handling them.\n",
    "2. The Route Framework routes simple categorizable queries to specialized agents.\n",
    "3. The React Framework uses a thinking-action-observation loop to solve reasoning and action problems.\n",
    "4. The Plan Framework creates and executes plans for complex multi-step problems.\n",
    "5. Direct LLM responses handle simple informational questions.\n",
    "\n",
    "This flexible architecture allows Ironbox to handle a wide range of query types efficiently, using the most appropriate approach for each situation."

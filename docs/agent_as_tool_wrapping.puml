' Add notes
note right of AW
  Agent wrappers convert specialized agents into tools:
  1. Take a query and parameters as input
  2. Create a minimal agent state
  3. Call the agent with this state
  4. Extract and return the response
end note

note right of SA
  Specialized agents implement a __call__ method
  that takes and returns an AgentState
end note

note right of ReF
  React and Plan frameworks can use
  agent-wrapped tools just like any other tool
end note

' Add notes
note right of RouterAgent
  Analyzes user input and determines
  which specialized agent should handle it
end note

note right of ReactProcess
  Iterative process of thinking,
  acting, and observing until
  the problem is solved
end note

note right of PlanningPhase
  Creates a detailed plan before
  execution, breaking the problem
  into manageable steps
end note

note right of DirectLLM
  Bypasses frameworks and agents
  for simple informational queries
end note

note right of Toolkit
  Unified repository for all tools and agents
  that can be accessed by any framework
end note

note right of AgentTools
  Specialized agents wrapped as tools,
  allowing React and Plan frameworks
  to use agents as tools
end note

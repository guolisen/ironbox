' Define participants
participant "Framework Selector" as FS
participant "React Framework" as ReF
participant "React Agent" as RA
participant "Tools" as T

' Define sequence
FS -> ReF : Select react framework
ReF -> RA : Process query

loop Until solution found
    RA -> RA : Generate thought
    RA -> RA : Decide action
    RA -> T : Execute tool
    T --> RA : Return observation
end

RA --> ReF : Return final answer
ReF --> FS : Return final response

' Add notes

@startuml Complete Query Flow

' Define participants
participant "User" as U
participant "Agent Core" as AC
participant "Framework Selector" as FS
participant "Selected Framework" as F
participant "Toolkit" as T
participant "Agents/Tools" as A

' Define sequence
U -> AC : Submit query
AC -> FS : Select framework
FS --> AC : Return framework type
AC -> F : Process with selected framework

loop Framework Processing
    F -> T : Look up tool/agent
    T --> F : Return function reference
    F -> A : Call tool/agent
    A --> F : Return result
end

F --> AC : Return final response
AC --> U : Return response to user

' Add notes
note over FS
  The Framework Selector analyzes the query and selects
  the most appropriate framework:
  - Route Framework for simple, categorizable queries
  - React Framework for multi-step reasoning problems
  - Plan Framework for complex planning problems
  - Direct LLM for simple informational queries
end note

note over T
  The Toolkit provides a unified interface to:
  - Local tools (Python functions)
  - MCP tools (external services)
  - Agent tools (specialized agents wrapped as tools)
end note

note over F
  The selected framework could be:
  - Route Framework: Routes to specialized agents
  - React Framework: Uses ReAct paradigm with tools
  - Plan Framework: Creates and executes a plan
  - Direct LLM: Generates a response directly
end note
